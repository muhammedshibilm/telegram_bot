# 🛡️ Telegram Moderation Bot

A simple Telegram bot built using Python and `python-telegram-bot` library to monitor group chats for inappropriate language and enforce moderation actions like warning, deleting messages, and banning users.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🚀 Start command to initialize the bot in a group.
- 👀 Monitors text messages in group chats.
- ❌ Detects bad words (e.g., *idiot*, *fool*).
- ⚠️ Issues warnings to users using inappropriate language.
- 🗑 Deletes offensive messages.
- 🚫 Bans users after repeated violations.
- 📊 `/warnings` command to check current warning count.

---

## 🧾 Commands

| Command       | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `/start`      | Starts the bot and sends a welcome message               |
| `/warnings`   | Displays the number of warnings the user currently has   |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The bot scans all text messages (excluding commands).
2. If any **bad word** from the `bad_words` set is detected:
   - The message is **deleted**.
   - The user is issued a **warning**.
   - If a user receives **2 or more warnings**, they are **banned** from the group.

├── main.py               # Main bot logic
├── .env                  # Environment variables (BOT\_TOKEN)
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
└── README.md             # This file

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
````

> ⚠️ Do **NOT** share your bot token or push the `.env` file to public repositories.

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-moderation-bot.git
cd telegram-moderation-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Your Bot Token

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
echo "BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here" > .env
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

Your bot will start polling and monitoring the group.

---

## 🌐 Deploying to Render

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create a new **Web Service** on [Render](https://render.com/).
3. Connect your GitHub repo and set:

   * **Start Command**: `python main.py`
   * **Environment Variable**:

     * `BOT_TOKEN`: your actual bot token
4. Deploy!

> ✅ No need for a webhook; polling is sufficient for this use case.

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

* Add more customizable bad words via commands.
* Log offenses to a database.
* Admin-only commands to reset warnings or unban users.
* Add a dashboard for moderation metrics.
